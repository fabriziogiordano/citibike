# Fab CitiBike Bookmark

The @CitiBikeNYC iOS app does not allow to bookmark stations so I used their API and created a nodejs app that parse their data and just show me the top 4 stations I care.

The list of bookmarks is in the data folder.

When either bikes or docks are below 2 then the color of the text is red.
When either bikes or docks are above 10 then the color of the text is green.

Unfortunatelly I could not find how to deep link to the iOS app directly to that station.

I hope @CitiBikeNYC will bring the bookmark feature back.
